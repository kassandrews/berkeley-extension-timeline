                    <h1>Our Roots</h1>
                        <p>In 1891, Berkeley faculty started teaching courses in history, philosophy,
                        mathematics and English to the public in San Francisco, with great success (over
                        800 learners in the first fall semester). This initiative came to life as a reaction
                        to calls from the Californian people to make the university’s education offerings
                        more accessible and to fully embrace its mission as a land grant university. Indeed,
                        until today, the University of California is bound “to serve society as a center of
                        higher learning, providing long-term societal benefits through transmitting advanced
                        knowledge, discovering new knowledge, and functioning as an active working repository
                        of organized knowledge”​. For the founders of the university’s Extension, this mission
                        meant providing access to learners of all ages and as a consequence, they pioneered
                        the uniquely American concept of lifelong learning through continuing education.
                        In fact, the name of ‘lifelong learning’ was coined by one of Extension's first deans,
                        Sean J. Richardson.</p>
                        <p>The reason for the creation of the University of California as well as its Extension
                        in the late 19th century, was to accelerate the economic development of California 
                        to catch up with the roaring industrialization on the East Coast (Figure 1). However, before 
                        Extension was born, the university consisted only of a few posh buildings and a theater 
                        on a remote hill, in the vicinity of the sleepy East Bay town of Berkeley (Figure 2). 
                        Privileged sons and daughters of wealthy families were studying and preparing themselves 
                        for high level positions in research, politics, public administration, and business. 
                        With the idea to give access to its excellent educational offerings to people of all 
                        ages, who would attend a single course at a time, while working, Extension breached 
                        the gap of academia and professional world, and created one the most advanced and 
                        successful continuing education department in history.</p>

                    <h1>Our Reach</h1>
                        <p>The central concept of Extension, as envisioned by it’s first proponents, notably 
                        the two UC Presidents, Edward S. Holden and Horace Davis, has always been the 
                        accessibility to the courses offered by our instructors. Consequently, Extension 
                        courses took place where the learners worked and lived, not on the remote campus 
                        in Berkeley. After the immediate success of its first courses, the regents officially 
                        adopted an extramural instruction plan that formally established the University 
                        Extension on Valentine’s Day, February 14, 1893. The concept of accessibility and 
                        the willingness to go towards the learners led Extension to constantly innovate 
                        new ways of reaching learners, for example, in 1928 Extension teaches on commuter 
                        trains, in 1945 Extension taught over 26,000 learners via its correspondence courses, 
                        in 1994 Extension ventures into online education and in 2012 Extension creates the 
                        UC’s first online course production department BRCO.</p>
                        <p>Today, in part due to the global pandemic, Extension has developed the capacity 
                        to reach learners beyond the Bay Area with live instruction. Learners from anywhere 
                        in the world are now able to join our courses and we can help them, to launch or 
                        change their careers, to support their families, and share their knowledge and the 
                        Berkeley mindset.</p>
