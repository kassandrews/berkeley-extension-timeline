                    <h1> 1911 to 1920</h1>
                    <p>In 1912, the university came under intense pressure from the people of southern California to createa new, rival institution. To answer the calls, but without wanting to concede to creating a new university all together, the university’s
                        president, Benjamin Ide Wheeler recruited Ira Woods Howerth from the University of Chicago to create a strong Extension presence in the southern parts of the state. It turned out that Howerth was even more of an idealist than
                        Stephens and openly stated his vision for Extension to serve the people of the state in the ways they wanted and needed to be served, irrespective of University ideals. To achieve this objective, he designed a trail blazing organizational 
                        structure and implemented visionary new departments: Beyond the original class instruction, he revived the popular public lectures and added entertainment to them, he created departments for debate and public discussion as well as
                        information and social welfare. To reach even more people, he pioneered correspondence instruction and allocated an entire department to it which served up to 5,500 students in 1917. Extension also began working with other institutions in
                        offering classes to specific audiences whose need for education was particularly telling-for instance, the inmates at San Quentin and Folsom prisons. </p>
                    <p>In 1915, Extension ventured into new forms ofeducation and set up the Department of
                        Visual Instruction to exploit the new motion picture technology for educational purposes. Howerth was an idealistic visionary clearly ahead of his time,and as such the university implemented regulatory bodies that govern Extension until today, 
                        including the Academic Senate Committees on Extension (1912) and Courses of Instruction (1913). In1917 Extension began offering courses in Los Angeles a full two years before the university finally gave into the calls of the public and in 1917 
                        established its second campus, UCLA. By the time Howerth was let go from the university while serving in World War I in 1918, he had managed toestablish Extension as the fundamental institution and model of the higher and continuing education it is today in California and around the 
                        world. At the end of the first world war, California experienced an economic boom accompanied by a dramatic increase of population, which meantthat suddenly there was a greater need, and more money available, for education to offer its basic academic 
                        curriculum, Extension began providing vocational and training courses to thousands ofveterans and to others eager to compete in new industrial markets.</p>

                    <h1> 1921 to 1930</h1>
                    <p>In the 1920s, Professor Leon Richardson served as Director of Extension and reintroduced the idealsof Liberal Arts
                        education into the educational standards and offerings, and recruited standard faculty again. His humanistic vision for
                        Extension was that of ‘lifelong learning’, a term for which is widely credited, and which made Extension a national model
                        and him a leading figure in Continuing Education. In 1923, in collaboration with the American Federation of Labor,
                        Extension launched the Workers' Education Bureau of America, which offered courses in economics, public speaking, and labor 
                        problems and history. Despite the fact that many faculty were reluctant to lecture to ordinary adult learners, notably in 
                        mission-driven programs targeted at workers, Extension grew rapidly and by 1924, ranked second in the country in the number 
                        of continuing education courses offered by an institution of higher education.</p>
